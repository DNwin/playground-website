Thursday night with the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks hosting the Packers in their quest to become the first team to repeat since the 2003-04 Patriots and the first NFC team to repeat since the 1992-93 Cowboys. The Jets begin Sunday at home against the Raiders with the Giants opening Monday night in Detroit.

As the NFL approaches its 100th season, the Daily News poll will put into perspective how players from different eras are judged against one another, what positions are considered the most valuable and whether more of the greatest players have played offense or defense.

Here’s what we asked our panel to do: Vote on their top 30 players in order, regardless of position, regardless of era. Then we assigned 30 points for a first- place vote, 29 for a second down to one point for a 30th-place vote.

That provided enough names to come up with a who’s-who for the Top 50.

Did incredible players make the list? Of course. Did incredible players not make the cut? No doubt. It was easier to make the Hall of Fame than our top 50.
