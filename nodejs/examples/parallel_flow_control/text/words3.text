Quick preview: Former Giants GM Ernie Accorsi, a real student of the history of the game, had Brady fifth and Manning 20th. “It’s not that I think there is such a gap between them,” Accorsi said. “It’s the players in between that I just had to get in. Had I just listed the QBs, it would have been a tossup. There wasn’t a player, as I got into it, that I hesitated because I thought he was too high. But in every case, once I got past the first seven or eight, I was concerned the player was too low. These players are all so great.”
